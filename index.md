## hello, world

Hi there, welcome to Yen-Shan's BLOG

### Why do I start a blog?

Frist of all, my propose is to write down my life that I can't stike a balance to get somthing I want to do.  

Secondly, now I learn English by myself to use online-resources such as youtube, Coursera, OCW(Open Course Ware) etc. and I'd like to share to you my experience how I use the resouces to improve my language skill .

第3個理由是生存於網路至上的年代，用github創博客是ㄧ種文青的展現，我相信非正宗碼農/程式猿/工程獅也能打打簡單的指令進行。

### What do I write an article?

The major subject is to share online-learning materials and record my learning English dairy in blog.

Second, it is really fun to learn English that you will find out more interesting things you've never knew. Therefore, I want to share you my experience.Although there are many self-learning materials we can take, we have no time to understand whether the material is useful for ourselves. For solving this problem, I decide to write down the materials what to learn, where to get, how to use.


### What do I want to be...

I wish I can use English fluently to create more opportunities such as to get better job, to meet foreign friends, to explore different culture etc.. 

### 寫博客的理由，未完待續
